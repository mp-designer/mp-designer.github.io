## Project Overview

TrackMate is a mindful, manual time tracker built as a Progressive Web App, designed not just for logging hours but for generating insights into time quality and encouraging reflection.

TrackMate is a mindful time and activity tracker that helps you plan, log, and get insights manually and with intention across all your devices, without relying on algorithms.

## Context and Problem

Saturated Market: The internet is flooded with automatic and manual time trackers, making it difficult for new entries to stand out.

Quantitative Limitation: Existing solutions primarily focus on the quantity of time spent, providing raw data (e.g., hours and minutes) but failing to capture its context or quality.

Lack of Actionable Insights: Users are left with numerical logs but no understanding of their focus levels, energy expenditure, or the effectiveness of their work sessions. This prevents meaningful reflection and improvement.

The Opportunity: To develop a new class of time tracker that shifts the focus from simple measurement to qualitative analysis, helping users understand the story behind their time and address specific activity-related challenges.

## Goals

* To design MVP for launch and first adapters testing;
* Improve acquisition, engagement and reduce retention of users; 
* Collect feedback and improve user experience;
* Contribute to iteration planning;
* Prepare base for SaaS model: freemium and subscription set of features.

## Summary

Redesigned and kept the project consistent, improved core flows, and identified UX gaps through testing that led to new features. Contributed to iteration planning, worked with analytics to improve acquisition, engagement, and retention. Proposed guest mode as a solution for increasing sign-ups. Researched and implemented non-intrusive notification flows.
