## Product Overview

A unified digital environment combining **9 interconnected products**, linking customers, partners, sales, and technical teams across front- and back-office operations.

The ecosystem covers industrial **infrastructure** management, **monitoring**, repair network coordination, **logistics** management, and a professional equipment **e-commerce** platform — streamlining collaboration and improving transparency across the mining value chain.

## Problem

Developed independently by 3 separate teams, the platform evolved without a unified UX vision — resulting in **inconsistent** interfaces, duplicated patterns, and fragmented workflows across nine interconnected products.

Continuous feature expansion added layers of **complexity**, making everyday operations **confusing** and inefficient for users.

On the customer side, the platform lacked proper **mobile adaptation**, despite a growing mobile user base.

As the company prepared to enter the **B2B** market, these issues exposed the urgent need for a cohesive and **scalable design** foundation.

## Goals

To **unify** the fragmented user experience across nine interconnected products, **simplify** complex workflows, and establish a **scalable UX foundation** that supports both web and mobile users — preparing the ecosystem for B2B market expansion.

## Summary

* Adapted **data-heavy dashboards** for mobile (~60% users) — improved usability and optimized large tables with smarter filtering.
* Validated a new **payment flow** through iterative user testing and feedback synthesis.
* Unified client and back-office repair workflows to ensure **consistency** across the ecosystem.
* Maintained and evolved an **Atomic Design-based system**, accelerating delivery through reusable components.
* Researched transition from online store to marketplace and designed complete **B2B SaaS** concept, including **multi-seller checkout** functionality.
* Designed **sub-account** management system enabling B2B account managers to monitor and manage multiple client accounts within a single interface.
* Conducted cross-team workshops to standardize UI element naming conventions, improving communication **efficiency** between developers, designers, and business analysts.
* **Reduced** design-to-development **time** for backoffice products through creation of a comprehensive internal design system.
* Led **conceptual** UX design for major product evolution — defining the experience vision, unifying system logic, and setting direction for a **scalable** redesign.

## Process

### Team Structure 

* 3 development teams (each with developers, PMs, QAs, and Business Analysts)
* 3-person design team with flexible project ownership
* 3-person marketing team supporting all products
* Dedicated stakeholders per project

### How We Worked Together

#### Strategy
Stakeholders and Business Analysts defined business goals and product direction.

#### Research & Ideation
Business Analysts partnered with designers to research user needs and explore solutions.

#### Design & Development
Designers used **Design Thinking** methodology, conducting user testing when deadlines allow, collaborating closely with dev teams to implement features.

#### Testing & Refinement
Continuous cycles of development, testing, and improvements.

#### Our Approach
The design team maintained full visibility across all projects. We each owned specific areas but shared knowledge through regular workshops, ensuring everyone could support any project when needed.

#### Working Methods
Design team operated in **Kanban** for flexibility, while dev teams used **Scrum**. To stay aligned, designers actively participated in key **Scrum ceremonies** including daily standups, pre-grooming sessions, grooming, and retrospectives. This embedded collaboration ensured design stayed synchronized with development priorities and timelines.

## Hosting

Hosting is a monitoring system for all clients' devices set on the mining farm, a transparent invoice payment system, and device settings.

### Mobile Dashboard Optimization

Redesigned high-density data dashboards for mobile to serve 60% of users who were struggling with complex tables and graphs on smaller screens. 

Improved readability and interaction patterns for data-heavy interfaces, ensuring critical information remained accessible across devices.

### Data Visualization & Filtering Enhancement

Enhanced **data visualization** in tables across desktop and mobile after new data types were introduced. 

Conducted domain expert **interviews** and analyzed customer **feedback** from account managers to identify pain points. 

Redesigned **filtering** system to handle increased data complexity while maintaining usability.

### Shift to a B2B SaaS model

I designed a **sub-account system** that allows **B2B** customers, who manage devices on behalf of multiple end-clients, to clearly separate devices by client, monitor each client’s device group, and download billing files at the client level. The feature also enables giving each client limited dashboard access so they only see data related to their own devices.

I **collaborated** closely with a team of designers and business analysts to define the end-to-end interaction model, ensuring the feature aligned with the workflows and constraints of every product in the ecosystem. The proposal was **validated by stakeholders** and approved for full implementation, becoming the foundation for the system’s new multi-account operations.

### Sales Backoffice Tools

Supported and improved the backoffice system used by sales managers to generate client bills based on individual usage data.

### Client Database Optimization

Increased **readability** and **efficiency** for sales team working with massive client database tables. 

Conducted employee **interviews** to identify workflow bottlenecks, defined key pain points, designed solutions, and validated improvements through **testing** with sales staff.

### Collaborative Design Process

Practiced paired design with 2nd designer and with Business Analysts, accelerating the iteration process and improving requirement alignment.

### Audit

Conducted thorough **heuristic** and **accessibility** audits of the hosting platform. Found critical usability and accessibility problems, then provided clear recommendations and solutions to improve product quality and make it more accessible to all users.
