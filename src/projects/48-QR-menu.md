## Project Overview

QR Menu is a lightweight digital menu and CMS system designed for small restaurants, cafés, bars and food trucks. It helps customers browse menus visually with translations and filters, while giving business owners a simple tool to update dishes, manage info, and share menus via QR codes — all without needing tech expertise.

## Context and Problem

Upon moving to Portugal, I noticed a recurring issue: ordering food at local restaurants was challenging for non-locals. Many establishments used handwritten Portuguese menus on blackboards, which were difficult to decipher, or lacked menus entirely, requiring verbal communication to understand offerings.

This created friction for:

* **Customers:** Language barriers, unfamiliar regional dish names, and lack of visual references made ordering difficult.
* **Restaurants:** Staff spent excessive time explaining menus, struggled to serve foreign customers efficiently, and faced challenges in consistently updating and sharing menu information.

## Goals

### Business Goals

* Deliver a mobile-first, QR-based menu solution for small restaurants in Portugal
* Improve accessibility for international customers through multilingual support and visuals
* Provide an easy-to-use CMS so owners can update menus without technical skills

### Design Goals

* Validate problem/solution fit through user research and expert interviews before scaling
* Prioritize core features into iterations for lean MVP delivery
* Reduce investment risk by testing business model viability early

## Outcomes
* **Defined target audience and prioritized core features** into phased releases, enabling step-by-step validation and efficient MVP planning.
* **Estimated market potential** with a freemium and paid SaaS model, projecting €8K–€25K annual revenue in year one based on research and benchmarks.
* **Designed visual menus** to address tourist pain points and improve clarity in decision-making during dining.
* **Created a simple CMS concept** allowing non-technical owners to update menus independently, reducing reliance on external agencies.
* Reduced investment risk by validating problem-solution alignment through user research, domain expert interviews, and usability testing of prototypes.

## Solution 

We defined a concept and interactive prototype split into two parts: a customer-facing menu and a restaurant CMS.

For customers, the menu focused on filters, visuals, and multilingual clarity, reducing friction in food selection.

For restaurant owners, the CMS concept offered simple menu management, QR code generation, and basic analytics without requiring technical skills.

## Validation Activities
* Clickable prototype shared with café owners in Viseu
* Collected qualitative feedback + pricing expectations
* All were interested in using a free tier; about 30% expressed willingness to pay
* Gathered contacts for early access beta

## Pause & Strategic Pivot
Despite promising feedback, we made a deliberate decision to pause.

**Why:**
* Concept lacked enough "product-led growth" hook to justify even low-cost subscriptions
* Without external funding or organic virality, releasing it for free wasn’t sustainable
* Further investment would’ve required deeper integration (e.g., POS, orders, payments)
