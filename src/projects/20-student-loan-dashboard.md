## Product Overview

A mobile-first redesign of a student loan platform homepage into a clear, **functional dashboard**, focused on reducing cognitive load and helping users instantly understand their financial status and next steps.

## Problem

The existing homepage of the student loan management tool had several critical issues:
* Cognitive overload
* Key information was hard to find
* Outdated visual design
* No mobile adaptation

## Goals

1. Transform Homepage into a functional dashboard
2. Make **mobile-first** solution
3. Make **“What do I owe?”** and **“What should I do next?”** instantly clear

<br>
<br>

## Summary

This design challenge focused on transforming an overloaded homepage into a task-oriented dashboard for student loan management. 

It was a completely new domain, which required quick immersion into student loan terminology, user concerns, and best practices.

Through rapid domain research, I identified key user anxieties and redesigned the experience to prioritize critical information, improve data visualization, and support mobile usage. 

The result is a clear, scannable interface that answers users’ core questions at a glance.

## Process

### Research

Conducted foundational domain research and identified key student loan terminology.

<br>

**Main user anxieties:**
* Missing payments
* Not understanding loan status
* Confusing terminology

<br>

**Users scan first for:**
* Total balance
* Payment due / next payment
* Loan status

<br>
<br>

#### Mood Board

Created mood boards focused on:
* Domain context
* Visual style
* Data visualization patterns

<br>
<br>

### Information architecture and Navigation

The original page was designed as a traditional homepage with an **overloaded amount of information**, making it difficult to distinguish priorities.

It also lacked **critically important data** for students managing their loans.

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

Main decisions: 
1. Change the page structure from Homepage → Dashboard to make it functional and task-oriented
2. Optimize and redesign navigation based on domain best practices
3. Design mobile-first, with thoughtful adaptation for larger screens

<br>
<br>
