### My impact

* Created flexible and well adaptive components with ready interactions, that helped to optimise the process of design and prototyping of design team;
* Wrote about 80% of detailed guidelines for design system;
* After tight work with Material design and some issues with creation of new components in design system I influenced the other designers to keep the principles of material design.
