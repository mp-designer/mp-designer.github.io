## Project overview

Logistics module is an internal project and a part of MYRIG ecosystem for covering needs of logistics department as well as business needs of the company.

MYRIG ecosystem – innovation ecosystem for efficient mining including industrial mining infrastructure, repair shop chain and professional mining equipment marketplace.

## Goal

At the time of my work in the company, the project was in active development.

I also reduced the time and costs of the development process by addressing complex issues and foreseeing variable scenarios.

Design solutions from this project influenced other company initiatives.

The UI library I created was successfully reused in another MUI 4-based project.
