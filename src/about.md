Hi, I'm Margo. A Product Designer from Ukraine with 5 years of experience building clear and effective digital solutions.

I bring a strategic view to my work, informed by an interest in business, marketing, and accessibility. I believe great products are built when teams collaborate effectively.

My experience includes:

• Complex ecosystems, ERP, CRMs, and admin panels
• MVPs and concept design for startups
• Mobile apps and responsive websites
• Design systems and guidelines
• Usability and Accessibility audits
• Brand identity

Outside of work, I'm enthusiastic about building community by organizing events for fellow digital nomads. 

I source my energy from two passions. A deep engagement with the arts — painting, cinema, live music, and a book club — that sharpens my creative perspective and eye for detail. In parallel, an active and challenging lifestyle builds the resilience and focus needed to tackle any complex design problem.
