Hi, I'm Margarita Perevalova, a UX designer from Ukraine. 

When I was a child, my mother, a skilled seamstress, inspired my creativity. I started designing and creating dresses for my dolls with the leftover fabric scraps from her sewing projects. When my parents asked me who I wanted to be, I answered, " A designer of clothes." It was my childhood dream.

My passion for design and art began at a young age: I sewed clothes for dolls, drew pictures and banners, tried body art, academic painting, photo shooting and retouching. 

Finally, my dream came true through a long life path. Now, I'm an experienced UX designer, or "designer of cloth" for user interfaces. After entering the UX sphere, I started to value a minimalist lifestyle and simple things. I sincerely enjoy the usability of everyday things such as food packages or household items.

My experience in UX design has taught me to think several steps ahead, be curious about how things work and strive for simplicity and efficiency in all design aspects. I approach each project with a passion for creating seamless user experiences, always aiming to make the digital world more intuitive and enjoyable for everyone.
